"""Geostatistics compute tasks.

This package groups all geostatistics-topic compute tasks:

- **kriging** — Kriging interpolation
- **break_ties** — Spatial tie-breaking
- **location_wise** — Per-location ensemble statistics

Task modules are imported here to trigger runner registration with the
central :class:`~evo.compute.tasks.common.runner.TaskRegistry`.

Example:
    >>> from evo.compute.tasks import run, SearchNeighborhood
    >>> from evo.compute.tasks.geostatistics.kriging import KrigingParameters
    >>>
    >>> result = await run(manager, KrigingParameters(...), preview=True)
