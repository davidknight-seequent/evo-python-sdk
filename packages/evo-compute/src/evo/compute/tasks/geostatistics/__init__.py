"""Geostatistics compute tasks.

This package groups all geostatistics-topic compute tasks:

- **kriging** — Kriging interpolation
- **break_ties** — Spatial tie-breaking
- **declustering** — Grid-based declustering weights
- **location_wise** — Per-location ensemble statistics
- **continuous_distribution** — Continuous non-parametric cumulative distribution
- **loss_calculation** — Classification by expected economic loss
- **normal_score** — Normal score transformation
- **profit_calculation** — Classification by expected economic profit
- **simulation_report** — Simulation result reporting

Task modules are imported here to trigger runner registration with the
central :class:`~evo.compute.tasks.common.runner.TaskRegistry`.

Example:
    >>> from evo.compute.tasks import run, SearchNeighborhood
    >>> from evo.compute.tasks.geostatistics.kriging import KrigingParameters
    >>>
    >>> result = await run(manager, KrigingParameters(...), preview=True)
