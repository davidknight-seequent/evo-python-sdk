## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend.

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have:

* **A registered Evo app**

    *Evo apps* provide the credentials necessary to generate Evo access tokens, which in turn provide access to your Evo data. An app can be created by you or by a member of your team.
    
    Register an Evo app in the [Bentley Developer Portal](https://developer.bentley.com/my-apps). For in-depth instructions, follow this [guide](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens) on the Seequent Developer Portal.

    NOTE: You must have a **Bentley developer account** in order to create apps. If you try to register an app using the link above but find that you don't have permission, contact your account administrator to get access.

* **A local copy of this repository**

    Clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file from the green **Code** button at the top of the page.

* **A Python code editor, eg. VS Code, PyCharm**
    
    For running and editing the sample notebooks and other source code files.

* To learn about contributing to this repository, take a look at the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Quick start for notebooks

Once you have an Evo app registered and the SDK installed, you can load and work with geoscience objects in just a few lines of code:

```python
# Authenticate with Evo
from evo.notebooks import ServiceManagerWidget

manager = await ServiceManagerWidget.with_auth_code(
    client_id="<your-client-id>",
    cache_location="./notebook-data",
).login()
```

> **Output:**
>
> ![ServiceManagerWidget](docs/img/service-manager-widget.png)
> 
> *A browser window opens for authentication. After login, select your organization, hub, and workspace from the dropdowns.*

```python
# Enable rich HTML display for Evo objects in Jupyter
%load_ext evo.widgets

# Load an object by file path or UUID
from evo.objects.typed import object_from_uuid, object_from_path

obj = await object_from_path(manager, "<your-object-path>")

# OR

obj = await object_from_uuid(manager, "<your-object-uuid>")
obj  # Displays object info with links to Evo Portal and Viewer
```

> **Output:**
>
> ![PointSet object display](docs/img/pointset-output.png)

```python
# Get data as a pandas DataFrame
df = await obj.to_dataframe()
df.head()
```

> **Output:**
> |   | x | y | z | Ag_ppm Values |
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> | 0 | 10584.40 | 100608.98 | 214.70 | 12.5 |
> | 1 | 10590.21 | 100615.43 | 220.15 | 8.3 |
> | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Typed objects like `PointSet`, `BlockModel`, and `Variogram` provide pretty-printed output in Jupyter with clickable links to view your data in Evo. As support for more geoscience objects is added, geologists and geostatisticians can interact with points, variograms, block models, grids, and more — all through intuitive Python classes. To determine the path or UUID of an object, visit the [Evo Portal](https://evo.seequent.com) or use the `ObjectSearchWidget`.

For a hands-on introduction, see the [simplified object interactions](code-samples/geoscience-objects/simplified-object-interactions/) notebook. For a complete geostatistical workflow including variogram modelling and kriging estimation, see the [running kriging compute](code-samples/geoscience-objects/running-kriging-compute/) notebook.

## Getting started with Evo code samples

For detailed information about creating Evo apps, the authentication setup, available code samples, and step-by-step guides for working with the Jupyter notebooks, please refer to the [**code-samples/README.md**](code-samples/README.md) file. 

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything required to get started with Evo APIs. 

## Getting started with Evo SDK development


### Getting started

Now that you have installed the Evo SDK, you can get started by configuring your API connector, and performing a
basic API call to list the organizations that you have access to:

```python
from evo.aio import AioTransport
from evo.oauth import OAuthConnector, AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer
from evo.discovery import DiscoveryAPIClient
from evo.common import APIConnector
import asyncio

transport = AioTransport(user_agent="Your Application Name")
connector = OAuthConnector(transport=transport, client_id="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>")
authorizer = AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer(oauth_connector=connector, redirect_url="http://localhost:3000/signin-callback")

async def main():
    await authorizer.login()
    await discovery()

async def discovery():
    async with APIConnector("https://discover.api.seequent.com", transport, authorizer) as api_connector:
        discovery_client = DiscoveryAPIClient(api_connector)
        organizations = await discovery_client.list_organizations()
        print("Organizations:", organizations)

asyncio.run(main())
```

  for performing arbitrary Seequent Evo API requests

* [`evo-objects`](packages/evo-objects/README.md): for interacting with the Geoscience Object API
* [`evo-colormaps`](packages/evo-colormaps/README.md): for interacting with the Colormap API
* [`evo-blockmodels`](packages/evo-blockmodels/README.md): for interacting with the Block Model API
* [`evo-compute`](packages/evo-compute/README.md): for interacting with the Compute Tasks API

  tutorials, and API references

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Seequent software. Please have a look over our [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Getting started

All Python SDKs in this monorepo are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
We use [workspaces](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) in order to manage the different SDKs
published out of this repository.

With workspaces, `uv lock` operates on the entire workspace at once. `uv run` and `uv sync` operate on the workspace root by default, though both accept a `--package` argument allowing you to run a command in a particular workspace member from any workspace directory.

### Install UV

To install UV on your machine, run one of the following convenience scripts from the root of the repo. These scripts ensure everyone is using the same version.

#### Windows
```shell
./scripts/install-uv.ps1
```

#### Linux / macOS
```shell
./scripts/install-uv.sh
```
You can run the same script again whenever the version in the `UV_VERSION` file changes. It will replace your existing installation of UV.

### Install pre-commit hooks

Once you've installed UV, install pre-commit hooks. These are used to standardise development workflows for all contributors:

```shell
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Setting up and running Jupyter notebooks

Notebooks can be run in your tool of choice (e.g. VS Code). To use Jupyter (the default):

```shell
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
```

Then, in the directory of the notebook(s) you want to run:

```shell
uv run jupyter notebook
```

A browser should launch where you can open the notebooks for the current directory.
