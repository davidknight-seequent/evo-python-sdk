# Workflows

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various workflows for interacting with Evo services. These workflows are designed to help users understand and utilize the Evo Python SDK for common tasks.

## Available Workflows

## Prerequisites

Before running these workflows, ensure you have the following:
- A valid Evo account with the necessary entitlements.
- Evo app credentials (client ID and redirect URL).
- Python environment with the Evo Python SDK installed.

## How to Use

1. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to configure and execute the workflow.
