    "### API vs SDK Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses **direct File API calls** which:\n",
    "- ✅ Provides full control over API requests and responses\n",
    "- ✅ Shows detailed API response structures and metadata\n",
    "- ✅ Allows for advanced customization and fine-tuning\n",
    "- ✅ Helps understand the underlying service architecture\n",
    "- ✅ Useful for debugging and advanced use cases\n",

    "If you prefer a more streamlined experience with less boilerplate code, check out the `sdk-examples.ipynb` notebook in this same directory. The SDK examples show:\n",
    "- Simplified method calls using `FileAPIClient`\n",
    "- Automatic handling of complex API interactions\n",
    "- Direct integration with file uploads and downloads\n",
    "- Better error handling and validation\n",
    "- Recommended for most common use cases"
