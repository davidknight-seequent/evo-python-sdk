# Getting Started

## Geosoft GX for Python

This notebook uses [Geosoft GX for Python](https://github.com/GeosoftInc/gxpy) to extract data from a grid file and re-package it as an Evo-compatible geoscience object.

Visit the [Geosoft Github page](https://github.com/GeosoftInc) to learn more about Geosoft GX, including developer toolkits for .NET and C/C++ and the extensive documentation.

## System requirements

### Operating system

Geosoft GX for Python is only compatible with Windows-based computers - users of Linux or macOS will not be able to run this notebook or use the toolkit.

TIP: macOS users with an Apple silicon computer (M1 or higher) can install Windows in a virtual environment by using the **free version** of [VMware Fusion Pro](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/11/11/vmware-fusion-and-workstation-are-now-free-for-all-users/).
